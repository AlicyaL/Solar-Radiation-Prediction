# Prediction-Of-Solar-Radiation
Utilizing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a new solution for Solar Radiation is approached.

## Abstract
Most solar applications and systems can be reliably used to generate electricity and
power in many homes and offices. Recently, there is an increase in many solar required
systems that can be found not only in electricity generation but other applications such as solar
distillation, water heating, heating of buildings, meteorology and producing solar conversion
energy. Prediction of solar radiation is very significant in order to accomplish the previously
mentioned objectives. In this paper, the main target is to present an algorithm that can be used
to predict an hourly activity of solar radiation. Using a dataset that consists of temperature of
air, time, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, direction of wind and solar radiation
data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is constructed to effectively forecast solar
radiation using the available weather forecast data. Two models are created to efficiently create
a system capable of interpreting patterns through supervised learning data and predict the
correct amount of radiation present in the atmosphere. The results of the two statistical
indicators: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are performed and
compared with observed and predicted data. These two models were able to generate efficient
predictions with sufficient performance accuracy.


## Introduction
With the rise in technological advancements in our digital modern world, comes the rise in demand for
electricity. Solar Panels have become one of the most used devices for electricity production as it
has become more affordable and more efficient than ever. Solar radiation data is significant in
various sectors such as in conversion and generation of energy from sunlight, water heating, water
distillation and meteorology. Many solar technologies started to take full advantage of using
solar radiation as a foundation for producing electrical energy. Furthermore, insolation energy has
proven to be very valuable in other sectors as well, such as agricultural sectors and rainfall
measurement and detection. On the other hand, it also can have minor negative effects such as:
Radiation Exposure, UV and infra-red rays and climate change, thus making it more essential to
analyze the radiation data.

To address these problems and achieving proper radiation data for energy conversion and other
useful applications, many studies in the literature explored using various techniques of machine
learning to precisely obtain the necessary data. Generally, solar radiation data can be observed as a
time series produced by a random and stochastic process [5]. As a result, precise mathematical
modeling is necessary for efficient generalization. Hence, by using the historical data sample, it can be
mathematically interpreted as a conditional expectation by using a precise model.
